# Holberton School — hello_world

Simple Holberton project that prints "Hello, World" to stdout. Intended as an introduction to C projects, repository layout, and basic compilation.

## Requirements
- Unix-like OS
- GCC (or compatible C compiler)
- Basic shell

## Files
- hello_world.c — minimal program that prints `Hello, World`
- README.md — this file

(Adjust filenames to match your repository.)

## Build
Compile with sensible warnings enabled:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o hello hello_world.c
```

## Run
```
./hello
```
Expected output:
```
Hello, World
```

## Style
- Follow Holberton/C coding standards: consistent indentation, descriptive names, readable code.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.

## Contributing
Create a branch per feature or fix. Open a PR with a clear description of changes.

## License
Add an appropriate open-source license file (e.g., MIT) if you intend to publish.

Created for Holberton low-level programming exercises.
